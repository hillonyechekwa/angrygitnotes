Just to note I'm really pissed about this one. You think you are done with css
and then they come up with this lazy ass bullsh*t called styled systems
just because the can't write css or sass. I'm fucking angry at the moment.

Anyway there's this thing called chakra UI its a CSS in JS Library(Leave it to a nigerian to create something complicated and also give it a weird name)
its supposed to be this modular, accessible  and simple(LOL) component Library
Its strongly typed and uses these things called themes. Yeah and Dark mode. meh
Has tons of components.supports responsive design too. 

So chakra UI Literally works like 
most css in js libraries. After looking
at the docs, i feel i can handle it 
as long as i don't deviate from the docs
